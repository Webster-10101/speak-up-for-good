# Ideas and Notes (from previous long handover)

## Distribution Models to Consider (Drills)
- Free public (lead gen) - simplest: just expose nav, add basic analytics
- Email-gated - capture emails before/after completion, add to MailerLite
- Client-only - requires auth/access control, drills as package value-add
- Freemium - 1 drill free, rest gated/paid, or usage limits
- Paid product - “Drill Library” membership, requires Stripe + gating

## Suggested Validation Approach (low risk)
- Quiet test with 3-5 past/current clients first (direct links, no nav)
- Ask: would you use this between sessions? what blocks practice?
- Decide based on actual usage, not intentions

## Instrumentation / Tracking Ideas (lightweight)
- Basic: pageviews and completion events per drill
- Better: store drill completions (anonymous or email-linked) for funnel insights
- Decide privacy stance early (what data is acceptable)

## Funnel Integration Ideas
- Quiz archetype -> recommended drill(s) as next action
- Email sequence: quiz result -> “try this drill” -> “how did it go?” -> booking CTA
- Drills could become the lead magnet instead of the quiz (test)

## Product/UX Principles for Drills
- Grounded language (avoid “confidence” framing)
- Physical first, immediately usable pre-performance
- Clear timers, minimal controls, zero fiddly UI
- Consistent flow across drills

## Future Drill Ideas (optional backlog)
- Archetype-specific drills (rambler, overthinker, self-doubter, etc.)
- Difficulty modes (longer timers for beginner, shorter/no hints for advanced)
- Audio recording + playback (self-review, optional coach review)
- Community features (streaks, badges, sharing) - only if it supports practice
